Alextra

A web based extension to both Delaval's Alpro for Windows and Uniform Agri. Built for use on my dairy
farm and published for purposes of a backup and in case anyone else finds it useful. It's buggy and badly
written but it broadly works for what I need it for.

Major features:

-Real time access to data from Uniform Agri and Alpro for Windows
-Utilises milking times to produce a parlour display with fertility information
-Can be used to remotely monitor milking progress, speed etc
-Can identify transponders that are not identifying reliably
-Provides historical milking times and sorting gate records
-Can be used as an aid to sorting cows on Delaval sort gate
-Uses foot trimming records to generate lists of cows due to trim
-Uses Uniform agri records to identify cows for fresh cow checks or not seen bulling
-Dashboard shows a breakdown of animals and breeding statuses
-In depth KPIs for management analysis
